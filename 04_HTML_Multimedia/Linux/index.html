            <h2 id="what-is-linux">What is Linux?</h2>
            <p>
                Linux is a free and open-source operating system* (OS) that powers everything from personal computers to
                smartphones, servers, and even supercomputers. Originally created by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a> in 1991,
                Linux has
                evolved into a powerful and versatile platform used by millions of people worldwide.<br><br>

                Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is <a
                    href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">open-source</a>, meaning anyone can
                view, modify, and distribute its code. This collaborative nature has led to a rich ecosystem of Linux
                distributions, each tailored for different types of users.<br><br><br>

                *Linux is technically not an operating system (OS) on its own—rather, it is the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Kernel</a> of an OS.
                The kernel is the core part of an operating system, responsible for managing hardware resources and
                allowing
                software to interact with the computer's hardware. It handles crucial functions such as memory
                management, task scheduling, and input/output operations.<br><br>

                <img src="media/kernel.svg" height="250px"
                    alt="Diagram that shows a Kernel that &#34;connects&#34; hardware and applications.">
                <img src="media/linuxkernel.jpg" height="250px"
                    alt="Diagram that shows Kernel Space and User Space and it's components."> <br><br>

                When we refer to “Linux” as an operating system, we're usually talking about a Linux distribution. A
                Linux distribution bundles the Linux kernel together with other essential software (like the <a
                    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/" target="_blank">GNU Core Utilities</a>, package
                managers, graphical user interfaces and more) to form a complete operating system.
                These distributions are what users typically interact with when using “Linux.”<br><br>
                On this website, the term "Linux" is used for Linux distributions, while the term "Linux kernel" is
                used when we are talking about the kernel specifically.
            </p>

            <h2 id="use-cases">What is Linux used for?</h2>
            <p>
                Linux is an incredibly versatile operating system that powers a wide range of devices and platforms,
                from tiny embedded systems to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/"
                    target="_blank">powerful supercomputers</a>. Its adaptability and open-source nature have led
                to widespread adoption across several key sectors: <br><br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Servers and Cloud Infrastructure</h4>
                    One of the most significant use-cases of Linux is in servers. In fact, the vast majority of web
                    servers that power the internet, run on Linux. Popular server distributions like
                    Ubuntu Server, CentOS, and Debian are used by companies, governments, and organizations worldwide to
                    host websites, applications, and services<br><br>

                    Linux's stability, security, and resource efficiency make it the preferred choice for server
                    environments. Additionally, its compatibility with tools like Apache, Nginx, and Docker has
                    solidified its position as the backbone of modern cloud infrastructure, with major platforms like
                    AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offering Linux-based solutions for their customers.<br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Android and Mobile Devices</h4>
                    You may not realize it, but if you're using an <a href="https://www.android.com/"
                        target="_blank">Android</a> smartphone, you're actually using Linux!
                    Android, developed by Google, is built on the Linux kernel, which allows it to manage hardware
                    resources efficiently on mobile devices. <br><br>

                    While Android's user interface and software stack are quite different from traditional desktop Linux
                    distributions, its foundation is rooted in the same Linux kernel used in servers and desktop
                    systems. This has enabled Android to become the most widely used mobile operating system in the
                    world.<br><br>

                    Beyond smartphones, Linux also powers many other embedded systems—from smart TVs (many of which use
                    Android) to IoT devices and
                    even automotive systems in modern cars.<br>
                    There are also projects like <a href="https://ubuntu-touch.io/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Touch</a> and
                    <a href="https://postmarketos.org/" target="_blank">PostmarketOS</a>, which aim to create complelety
                    Linux-based mobile phone operating systems.<br><br>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>The Growing Desktop Market</h4>
                    Although Linux has long dominated servers and embedded systems, it's increasingly gaining traction
                    in the desktop market. While it only occupies a small percentage of total desktop users compared to
                    Windows and macOS, Linux's desktop presence is growing steadily.<br><br>

                    Linux distributions like <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>, <a
                        href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, and <a href="https://zorin.com/"
                        target="_blank">ZorinOS</a>offer user-friendly environments that make
                    it easier for everyday users to switch from proprietary operating systems. With advancements in
                    software compatibility, including tools like <a href="https://winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)" target="_blank">Proton</a>
                    (which allow running Windows
                    applications and games), Linux is becoming a more viable option for developers, gamers, and general
                    users alike.<br><br>

                    The open-source nature of Linux gives desktop users unparalleled customization options, making it a
                    great choice for people who value privacy, control, and flexibility. Additionally, the development
                    of powerful, lightweight desktop environments like <a href="https://gnome.org/"
                        target="_blank">Gnome</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE Plasma</a>, and <a
                        href="https://xfce.org/" target="_blank">Xfce</a> allows Linux to run
                    efficiently on both new and older hardware.<br><br>

                    <h4>Valve and the Steam Deck: Gaming on Linux</h4>
                    One of the most exciting developments for Linux in recent years has been its growing presence in the
                    gaming industry, largely thanks to Valve and their <a
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Valve, the
                    company behind the popular
                    gaming platform Steam, has long been an advocate for Linux, and their efforts have significantly
                    improved gaming on the platform.<br><br>

                    Valve's major contribution to gaming on Linux is Proton, a compatibility layer that allows many
                    Windows games to run on Linux. Proton enables Linux users to access a large portion of Steam's vast
                    game library without needing to run Windows.<br><br>

                    In 2021, Valve released the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming console which is designed to bring PC
                    gaming on the go, and its default
                    operating system, SteamOS, is a Linux distribution.<br><br>

                    Valve's investment in Linux through Proton and the Steam Deck has helped change the perception that
                    Linux is not suitable for gaming. By creating a smooth gaming experience on a Linux-based system,
                    Valve has pushed Linux gaming forward, inspiring more developers to consider supporting Linux
                    natively.<br><br>

            <h2 id="distributions">Linux Distributions</h2>
            <p>
                Linux Distributions contain a Kernel and all kinds of ofter software, that is required for an operating
                system.<br>
